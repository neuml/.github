# Support

The primary support forum for our projects is GitHub. We strive to have ample documentation to help understand the purpose of the project and the overall functionality. The following covers the primary ways to get help and support.

## Review existing issues and documentation

We're happy to help. But to get the most efficient answer to your question, please go through the following steps first.

1. Validate the issue is occuring with the latest version of the project. The issue may have already been fixed.

2. Read the project's README file. The issue may not be an issue but work a specific way for a reason. 

3. Review existing issues. If the same issue is already reported, respond in that issue to help bump it up in priority. The issue may also already be fixed but a new version not yet deployed.

## Report an Issue

If going through the steps above doesn't resolve the issue or question, the next step is opening an issue via the `Issues` tab for the project on GitHub. This helps document issues and debugging strategies for everyone.
